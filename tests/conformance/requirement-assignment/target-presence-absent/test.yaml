    - "relation_presence" function checks if the reqirement of "relation_one" of node_one is fulfilled or not and assigns true or false as condition accorndingly.
    - "target_presence" checks if target node is present or not.
    - since false is assigned as condition for target node_two, hence requirement is not fulfilled and false is assigned as condition for container.
    - container is absent.
